            grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, 
            forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct 
            forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most
             scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.</p>

        <p> 
            Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. 
            Their legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet. 
            They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, 
            or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances. ...

        <p> 
            Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and they're one of 
            the most unique-looking animals, too. With their characteristic long 
            noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is 
            no other animal with a similar physique.

             15 to 40 members. These prides include multiple adult males,
